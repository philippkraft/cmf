@page cmfTutFluxes Query fluxes and states

 
[back...](@ref cmfTutBoundary) [next...](@ref cmfTutSolver)


Every flux and every state can be accessed during runtime. Thus you can
save anything you like to the output during the run time loop. In the
following we will have a look at some techniques how to see what is
going on in a model. As an example model we use the very simple 2
storage model with boundary condition from CmfTutBoundary.

## Note for Python 2 users

To show our results, we are using Python's print statement / function.
However, "print" has changed between python 2 and 3. To run our examples
python 2 users should always start their programs with the following
line:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

from __future__ import print_function, division
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This import the behaviour of the python3 print function as well as the
improved handling of integer division into python 2. Using this line in
python3 is fine and changes nothing.

## Getting states

We have already asked for states in the example model. Every water
storage has the property `volume` to return the stored water volume in
mÂ³. More general, `state` returns the value stored in a state
variable, which is usually `volume` for a water storage and the tracer
mass for a solute storage. Water storages with a defined relation
between head and volume (such storages will be covered later, eg.
[SoilLayer](@ref cmf::upslope::SoilLayer) and
[OpenWaterStorage](@ref cmf::river::OpenWaterStorage)), can also give
back their `potential`.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

print(W1.volume)
print(W1.state)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The properties can also be used to change the states of the system, but
this is only useful for initial conditions. Changing the state during
runtime will of course destroy the water balance. Some of the
[solvers](@ref cmfTutSolver) will even ignore the changes if they are not
reset. In our [simple example](@ref cmfTutFirstModel)
we have used this already for the initial condition:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

W1.volume = 1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Getting fluxes

### Fluxes between two nodes

Getting fluxes is a little bit more complicated than getting states:
Some fluxes depend only on the state of the connected water storages,
like `LinearStorageConnection`, some on time, like the
[NeumannBoundary](@ref cmf::water::NeumannBoundary)
and some on both. Since the storages / nodes do not know, what time we
have (this is a property of the solver) you need to give the time into
the query.

Fluxes between two nodes `source` and `target` at time `t` can be
queried with the `flux_to` method:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

source.flux_to(target,t)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For our toy model you can query all fluxes the following way:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

# get the current time
t = solver.t
# Prints the fluxes in the model
print('In->',In.flux_to(W1,t),'->W1->',W1.flux_to(W2,t),'->W2->',W2.flux_to(Out,t))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You get the result of the **actual** flux between source and target in
@f$m^3/day@f$. If water is flowing from source to target, the result
is positive else negative. If source and target are not connected you
will get 0.0, and no error will occur. Since you get the actual flux,
summing up the fluxes does not necessarily reflect the true accumulated
flux, since in non-linear models, the integrated flux over a timestep
does not equal the sum. CMF is very mass conservative, since the water
volume is the integrated state variable, but by summing up you might get
the impression of numerical errors in the integration.

![](@ref cmfTutFluxes.png)

Now we are going to save the fluxes instead of the volume in a list in
our [first model with boundary conditions](@ref cmfTutBoundary) and plot
the result:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}


# Iterate the solver hourly through the time range 
# and return for each time step the fluxes between the nodes
result = [[In.flux_to(W1,t),W1.flux_to(W2,t),W2.flux_to(Out,t)] 
          for t in solver.run(datetime.datetime(2012,1,1),
                              datetime.datetime(2012,1,7),
                              datetime.timedelta(hours=1))]

# Plot the result
import pylab as plt
plt.plot(result)
plt.xlabel('hours')
plt.ylabel('flux in $m^3/day$')
plt.legend(('In->W1','W1->W2','W2->Out'))
plt.show()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The result of this code is on the right.

### All fluxes in and out of one node

You can get all fluxes of one node with `target.fluxes(t)`. You get a
list of tuples, each tuple composed of the flux and the target node.
**Note:** positive fluxes here mean fluxes into the target.

Example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

for flux,node in W1.fluxes(solver.t):
    print('%4.1f m3/day from %s' % (flux,node))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
-1.0 m3/day from {W2}                                                                                                                      
 0.0 m3/day from {Boundary at W1}    
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Getting the waterbalance of a node

If you want to know the current balance (sum) of the fluxes you can of
course do:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

wb = sum(flux for flux,node in W1.fluxes(solver.t))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

But you can also let cmf do the sum:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

wb = W1.waterbalance(solver.t)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

or even shorter:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

wb = W1(solver.t)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is especially useful for boundary conditions, however this does
also only show the **actual** waterbalance and not the average
waterbalance over a given timestep. Hence accumulating the waterbalance
over time leads to numerical errors.

If you need the exact waterbalance, you can create another waterstorage
and connect the boundary condition with an
[WaterbalanceFlux](@ref cmf::water::WaterbalanceFlux)

## Inspect your hydrological network

Sometimes, you might not be sure what storages are exactly connected to
each other, or the following tools are just simpler to use, then
inspecting your setup code.

Getting a list of all the connections of one node is done by the
`connections` property of a node (storage, boundary).

Example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

for con in W1.connections:
    print(con)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

prints:

    kinematic wave({W1}<->{W2})
    Neumann boundary flux({Boundary at W1}<->{W1})

`connected_nodes` is a list of the nodes that are connected to
another.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

for node in W1.connected_nodes:
    print(node)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

prints:

    {W2}
    {Boundary at W1}
