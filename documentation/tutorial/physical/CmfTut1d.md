@page cmfTut1d Create a one dimensional Richards equation based model

![](media/structure_cmf_1d.png)

A one dimensional highly detailed model, comparable to models like
BROOK90 (Federer 1995; Allen et al., 1998) or Hydrus 1D (Simunek et al.,
2005), is developed through the allocation of a number of soil water
storages, with connections based upon a Richards equation-based flux
connector. This very short and simple example shows just the percolation
through a homogeneous medium without any boundary flow. A more complete
example with rainfall and graphical output can be found in the download
section.

Create a project and one 1000mÂ² cell

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}
import cmf
from datetime import datetime,timedelta
project = cmf.project()
# Add one cell at position (0,0,0), Area=1000m2 with a surface water storage
cell = project.NewCell(x=0,y=0,z=0,area=1000, with_surfacewater=True)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a [retention curve](@ref cmfTutRetentioncurve)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}
r_curve = cmf.VanGenuchtenMualem(Ksat=1,phi=0.5,alpha=0.01,n=2.0)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add ten layers of 10cm thickness

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

for i in range(10):
    depth = (i+1) * 0.1
    cell.add_layer(depth,r_curve)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connect layers with Richards perc.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

for upper,lower in zip(cell.layers[:-1],cell.layers[1:]):
    cmf.Richards(upper,lower)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

this can be shorten as

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

cell.install_connection(cmf.Richards)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using this command, all layers of the cell get connected with Richards
equation.

Now we need to create an integrator for the resulting system. Since the
Richards equation procduces a very stiff (difficult to solve) system,
one needs to use an implicit solver with an adaptive time stepping
scheme. The [CVodeKrylov](@ref cmf::math::CVodeKrylov), a
wrapper for the
[CVODE-solver](https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html) by
Hindmarsh et al. (2005) is such a solver and recommended for all cmf
models using Richards equation.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

solver = cmf.CVodeKrylov(project,1e-6)
solver.t = cmf.Time(1,1,2011)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we set the initial conditions

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

# Set all layers to a potential of -2 m
cell.saturated_depth = 2.
# 100 mm water in the surface water storage for percolation
cell.surfacewater.depth = 0.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the setup code for our simple 1D Richards-Model. To run the
model we create the run time loop using the solver.run iterator and we
save soil moisture and potential for each layer into lists.

![](@ref CmfTut1d-result-no-boundary.png)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

# Save potential and soil moisture for each layer,
# start with initial conditions
potential = [cell.layers.potential]
moisture = [cell.layers.theta]
# The run time loop, run for 7 days
for t in solver.run(solver.t,
                    solver.t + timedelta(days=7),
                    timedelta(hours=1)):
    potential.append(cell.layers.potential)
    moisture.append(cell.layers.theta)
    
# Plot results
from pylab import *
subplot(211)
plot(moisture)
ylabel(r'Soil moisture $\theta [m^3/m^3]$')
xlabel(r'$time [h]$')
grid()
subplot(212)
plot(potential)
ylabel(r'Water head $\Psi_{tot} [m]$')
xlabel(r'$time [h]$')
grid()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The upper graph shows the soil moisture content of each layer, the lower
the water potential for each layer. The water table rises and a new
hydrostatic equilibrium at 1.35 m below ground is established

## Adding a groundwater boundary condition

As the next step, a fixed groundwater table as a lower boundary
condition is introduced into our model. The following line needs to be
inserted into the setup part of the script, eg. before setting the
initial conditions:

![](@ref CmfTut1d-result-gw-boundary.png)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}
# Create the boundary condition
gw = project.NewOutlet('groundwater',x=0,y=0,z=-2)
# Set the potential
gw.potential = -2 
# Connect the lowest layer to the groundwater using Richards percolation
gw_flux=cmf.Richards(cell.layers[-1],gw)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~


In this experiment, the water percolates through the soil and out of our
model boundaries. The water content is at the end of the simulation
period near to the orginal values.
