@page cmfTut2d A simple Darcian hillslope model

[last...](@ref cmfTutSurfaceRunoff)


In this chapter we will bring our 1D cell from \[\[wiki:CmfTut1d\]|and
the lateral connections from CmfTutDarcianLateralFlow and
CmfTutSurfaceRunoff together to a complete hillslope model. As in these
tutorials will not include rainfall and ET to keep the code better
readable. With the information from CmfTutTestData, CmfTutMeteostation
and \[wiki:CmfTutET\]\] it should be possible to extend this tutorial on
your own to a complete model.

## Define the hillslope

Here we will define the catena of cells on the hillslope. For "real"
applications, you will load the topography of the hill slope from a file
- here we use a simple function `z(x)`. The cmf project will be `p`
again.

### Import libraries, create project

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

import cmf
import numpy as np
def z(x): 
    return 10/(1+np.exp((x-100)/30))
# create a project
p = cmf.project()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Creating 20 cells

Our hill slope should have an exponential slope, is 200 m long and is
discretized into 20 cells. By using different cell areas, a quasi-3D
effect for converging or diverging fluxes could be applied, but in our
example the area of each cell is fixed to 10m x 10m.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

for i in range(20):
    x = i * 10.
    # create a cell with surface storage
    c = p.NewCell(x,0,z(x),100,True)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The [topological connection](wiki:CmfTutCell#topology) of the cells is
simple, we only need to connect each cell with its lower neighbor. The
width of the connection is 10m.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

for c_upper,c_lower in zip(p[:-1],p[1:]):
    c_upper.topology.AddNeighbor(c_lower,10.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, each cell needs to have soil layers, exactly the same way as in the
setup code in \[wiki:CmfTut1d\], just with some other layer depth and
the "default" Van Genuchten-Mualem retention curve - it is better to
parameterize your soil type of course (@ref cmfTutRetentioncurve).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

# Customize cells
for c in p:
    # create layers    
    for d in [0.02,0.05,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.5,0.75,1.0,1.25,1.5,1.75,2.]:
        rc = cmf.VanGenuchtenMualem(Ksat=50*np.exp(-d),alpha=0.1,n=2.0,phi=0.5)
        rc.w0 = 0.9996
        c.add_layer(d,rc)
    # set initial conditions
    c.saturated_depth=2.
    # use Richards connection
    c.install_connection(cmf.Richards)
    c.install_connection(cmf.GreenAmptInfiltration)
    # Add more connections here... (eg. ET, snowmelt, canopy overflow)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using `Darcy` and `KinematicSurfaceRunoff` as lateral connections as
in CmfTutDarcianLateralFlow and CmfTutSurfaceRunoff. Due to the defined
topology, we can use the `cmf.connect_cells_with_flux` function.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

cmf.connect_cells_with_flux(p,cmf.Darcy)
cmf.connect_cells_with_flux(p,cmf.KinematicSurfaceRunoff)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Create boundary conditions and solver

### Boundary conditions

For our example we will use the following boundary conditions:

1\. No flow to the deep groundwater (impervious bedrock) 2. No flow at
the upper side of the hillslope (upper side is water shed) 3. Steady
rainfall of 10mm/day to each cell 4. Constant head boundary at the low
end of the hillslope at 0.47m below the lowest cell in 10 m distance.

Boundary conditions 1 & 2 are implemented by doing nothing (no
connection is no flow). Boundary condition 3 is applied as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

for c in p:
    c.set_rainfall(10.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Boundary condition 4 (outlet) is applied by using a
[DirichletBoundary](@ref cmf::water::DirichletBoundary), using the
`NewOutlet` method of the project. The outlet is connected with the
[Darcy](@ref cmf::upslope::connections::Darcy) connection to each soil
layer. The surface water of the lowest cell `p\[\[-1\]`|is connected
to the outlet with
[KinematicSurfaceRunoff](@ref cmf::upslope::connections::KinematicSurfaceRunoff)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

outlet = p.NewOutlet('outlet',200,0,0)
for l in p[-1].layers:
    # create a Darcy connection with 10m flow width between each soil layer
    # and the outlet
    cmf.Darcy(l,outlet,FlowWidth=10.)
cmf.KinematicSurfaceRunoff(p[-1].surfacewater,outlet,10.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Solver

The last thing needed for the complete setup code is the solver. With
Richards and Darcy equation, we have again a stiff system and thus use
the CVODE solver:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

solver = cmf.CVodeKrylov(p,1e-9)
solver.t = datetime.datetime(2012,1,1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Visualization and runtime loop

In the runtime code, you need to define which data should be collected
during runtime and handle the data accordingly. In \[wiki:CmfTut1d\] we
have used two different approaches - save data to a file during runtime
and collect the data in a list for later visualization. You can of
course apply both techniques here also. However, if you want to observe
the state changes in a 2D hillslope and not only the runoff, an image
with time on the one axis and depth on the other is not sufficient.
Hence we are going to present the results live during the model run in
an animation.

First we need a kind of drawing, that shows all states. As always in
cmf, you can design the output as you like. One possibility, drawing
everey layer as a sheared rectangle colored by a state variable and
arrows indicating the flux between the layers is already bundled with
cmf in the `cmf.draw` module - the `hill_plot` class. This class is
not very well documented, but you can have a look to the source code.

This creates a `hill_plot` of our hillslope:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

# Import the hill_plot
from cmf.draw import hill_plot
# Import some matplotlib stuff
from matplotlib.pylab import figure,show,cm

# Create a new matplotlib figure fig
fig = figure(figsize=(16,9))
# Create a subplot with a light grey background
ax = fig.add_subplot(111,axisbg='0.8')
# Create the hillplot for water filled pore space with using a yellow to green to blue colormap
image = hill_plot(p,solver.t,cmap=cm.YlGnBu)
# Set the scale for the arrows. This value will change from model to model.
image.scale = 100.
# white arrows are nicer to see
image.q_sub.set_facecolor('w')
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Animations can be created using the `FuncAnimation` class from the
`matplotlib.animation` module. The drawing (and in our case advancing
of the model) is done in a function taking the frame number as the first
argument:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

def run(frame):
    # Run model for one day
    t = solver(cmf.day)
    # Update image
    image(t)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Last part is to create the animation object and show what we have done.
The animation starts directly.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation
animation = FuncAnimation(fig,run,repeat=False,
                          frames=365)
show()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The result after 30 days of simulation looks like this:

## Excercises

1\. Stop the rain after 100days. (a few minutes) 2. Save the outlet
water balance in a list and plot it after calculation (a few minutes) 3.
Use real weather data (some more work) 4. Use ET, snowmelt etc. (a few
minutes) 5. Go in the field, measure pF curves, collect meteo data and
discharge and make a real model. Learn from model failure (time...)
