Chaos in site-package paths: /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages

Throwing in another answer: Try checking your PYTHONPATH.

First, try and install wheel again:

pip install wheel
This should tell you where wheel is installed, eg:

Requirement already satisfied: wheel in /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages
Then add the location of wheel to your PYTHONPATH:

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages
Now building a wheel should work fine.

python setup.py bdist_wheel
